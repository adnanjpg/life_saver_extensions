# Life saver extensions 

this packaage contains some very useful extensions used every day, and some are used occasionally.

my really life saver favorite one is `joinWidgetList`.


## how to integrate into your project
this is not a good enough thing to be published on [pub.dev](https://www.pub.dev), so I'll keep it on github.

you can add it to your `pubspec.yaml` in 2 ways:
<details>
    <summary>if you're using ssh</summary>

    life_saver_extensions:
        git: git@github.com:adnanjpg/life_saver_extensions.git
</details>
<details>
    <summary>if you're not using ssh</summary>

    life_saver_extensions:
        git: https://github.com/adnanjpg/life_saver_extensions.git
</details>
